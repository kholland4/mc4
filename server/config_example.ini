#Number of parallel threads to use.
#'0' means to run only on the main thread (no parallel threads). This is the default.
#'-1' and other negative values mean to use as many as the CPU has.
#Any other number indicates the number of threads to use.
# threads = 0

[database]
#Database storage backend, options are:
#  'sqlite3' : Recommended. Stores everything to a SQLite database file on disk.
#  'memory'  : Primarily for testing. Does not persist to disk; known issues.

# backend = sqlite3
# sqlite3_file = test_map.sqlite

#Target size of primary mapblock cache.
#Recommended value is 500 * max number of concurrent players.
#1000 mapblocks ~= 30 MB memory
#(works out to roughly 15 MB/player)

# L1_cache_target = 10000

#Maximum size of secondary (compressed) cache.
#Lighting computation and map generation are expensive operations,
#so it's recommended to spend as much memory as possible on caching.
#This cache is much more space-efficient, so it should be a lot larger.
#1000 mapblocks ~= 1.5 MB memory
